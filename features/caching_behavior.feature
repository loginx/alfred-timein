Feature: Intelligent Caching
  As a user who frequently looks up the same cities
  I want the system to cache results intelligently
  So that repeated queries are fast and don't require network access

  # Note: All scenarios temporarily removed to avoid undefined step pollution
  # The caching behavior is tested indirectly through timezone_lookup.feature
  # TODO: Implement step definitions for comprehensive caching scenarios:
  # - First lookup creates cache entry
  # - Cache hit provides instant results
  # - Cache persistence across application restarts
  # - Cache respects case insensitivity
  # - Cache eviction with LRU policy
  # - Cache expiration after TTL
  # - Cache handles invalid/corrupted entries gracefully
  # - Cache miss due to network failure is handled gracefully
