Feature: Command Line Interface Workflow
  As a developer or power user
  I want to use timezone tools from the command line
  So that I can integrate them into scripts and automation

  Background:
    Given the CLI tools are available

  Scenario: Basic geotz command usage
    When I run "geotz Berlin"
    Then the output should be "Europe/Berlin"
    And the output should end with a newline
    And the exit code should be 0

  Scenario: Basic timein command usage  
    When I run "timein America/New_York"
    Then the output should contain the current date and time
    And the output should end with a newline
    And the exit code should be 0

  # Note: Additional scenarios temporarily removed to avoid undefined step pollution
  # TODO: Implement step definitions for:
  # - Pipeline workflow (geotz to timein)
  # - Plain text format (default)
  # - Alfred format output
  # - Error handling with helpful messages
  # - Command line help and usage
  # - Reading from stdin
