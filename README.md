# Alfred Workflow: `timein <city>`

A fast, zero-config Alfred workflow that tells you the current local time in any city using natural language input.

Type:

```bash
# In Alfred:
timein bangkok
timein new york
timein tokyo

# From the terminal:
npm run timein bangkok
```

And get:

```text
Asia/Bangkok (UTC+7)  Fri, May 2, 9:30 AM
```

## Features

- Natural city name input (`"timein London"`, `"timein SÃ£o Paulo"`)
- Lookup by airport codes (e.g., `"timein JFK"` for John F. Kennedy International Airport)
- Lookup by postal codes (e.g., `"timein 90210"` for Beverly Hills, California)
- Lookup by landmarks (e.g., `"timein Eiffel Tower"`)
- Instant results via `alfy` Script Filter
- Built-in debouncing via Alfred for efficient input handling
- Location resolution via OpenStreetMap (no API keys required)
- Advanced lookup capabilities (e.g., `"timein near Statue of Liberty"`)
- Accurate timezone mapping with IANA strings (`America/Toronto`)
- Minimal in-memory caching for repeat queries
- Fully tested with Vitest
- ESM-only codebase (Node.js 18+)

## Installation

1. Clone this repo into your Alfred workflows folder or develop with `alfred-link`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alfred-timein.git
    cd alfred-timein
    npm install
    ```

2. Link it with `alfred-link` (or package manually):

    ```bash
    npx alfred-link
    ```

3. In Alfred, type:

## Tech Stack

| Tool         | Purpose                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| `alfy`       | Alfred integration and Script Filter handling |
| `node-geocoder` | City name to coordinates (OpenStreetMap) |
| `tz-lookup` | Coordinates to IANA timezone string |
| `quick-lru` | Lightweight in-memory caching |
| `vitest`    | Unit testing framework |
| `Intl.DateTimeFormat` | Native date/time formatting |

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests cover core logic: geocoding, timezone resolution, formatting, and edge cases.

## Known Limitations

- Requires an internet connection for initial geocoding
- Results are English-only for now

## Roadmap Ideas

Want to contribute? Here are some next steps:

- Add timezone UTC offset display (`UTC+1`, etc.)
- Static alias map for nicknames like `"sf"`, `"nyc"`, `"la"`
- Offline fallback using city to timezone flatfile (optional)
- Support for `timein now` to show local system time
